  <h1>surveillance apps our society needs</h1>

  <p>we need to get into making apps. and by we i mean other people. i just have ideas. here are some interesting surveillance apps i’d like to see.</p>

  <h2>the spenddoxx app:</h2>
  <p>intuit has this new grift where they use artificial intelligence to categorize your spending and help you budget. personally i do not care about this data all that much but i am really interested in sharing the data with everyone on earth. years ago, a friend made a twitter bot for me that tweeted every single song i streamed on spotify as i listened to it. we briefly looked into doing this with credit card transactions but found that there wasn’t an api to access the transaction data. we tried mint and saw if chase bank would let me do it. i wanted to tweet the amount and location of all my spending, but the big tech overlords prevented me from democratizing the data. there was a moment in the late 2010’s when people were obsessed with snooping on people’s venmo timelines. imagine that but for every transaction. beautiful. gorgeous. we could all know so much more about each other.</p>

  <h2>the locationdoxx app:</h2>
  <p>we have this. we’ve had many iteration of it. the best is currently find my friends. but we need some freaking features. simplicity can be beautiful for those with no curiosity. those who don’t embrace complexity to seek truth must love a good barebones apple app. but that’s simply not me. i want notifications when 3+ of my friends are in the same place. i want to send a push notification to a list of users within a one mile radius of me that they’re welcome to pull up to my current location and queen out. i want historical data on where people have been instead of just real-time data on where they are. there are some apps that track where you’ve been and then don’t share it. i use fog of world and mapcred. this data could be used to make recommendations to people but it’s not. the problem with asking people for recommendations is that they often are making some compromised rather than telling you what they like. they’re trying to guess what you like. they’re trying to tell you something that makes them seem cool or esoteric or rich. i want to just look at a database of where they actually go. i want to go on the locationdoxx app and type “coffee shop near me” and i want it to tell me “your friend vanessa goes to cafe grumpy a lot” simply because she actually goes there and not because she explicitly recommended it to me and i want to go there and i want to text vanessa and say “hey queen i went to your favorite cafe and it was everything.”</p>

  <h2>the frienddoxx app:</h2>
  <p>people are addicted to getting your instagram and going through the people they know that follow you. i love when partiful shows me people i’ve partied with before. there is a big social graph that exists on social media that’s difficult to navigate because it’s not filterable and visualizable in the right ways. i want a social graph with edges and nodes that i can use to figure out what the hell is going on. when i meet a new person i want to see a list of every single person we know in common so that i can do a vibe assessment and see how much clout they have. it can be as simple as filtering a big social graph to people that are connected to both ben and me. we can also see how they’re connected. imagine if you could invite people to a party by simply drawing a border on a social graph to include a certain squad. this is mostly just a visualization tool that likely already exists but probably doesn’t have cool and interesting features.</p>

  <p>if you know of any apps that feel like they doxx all their users, please send them my way. i’ll become a power user.</p>

  <h1>reflections on the quasimatt hierarchy of needs</h1>

  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/iDpcbOn.jpeg" alt="quasimatt hierarchy of needs" style="width:100%; max-width:600px; margin: 20px 0;">

  <h2>level 1: queening out</h2>
  <p>i realized recently that a lot of my friends frame social activity, especially forming new relationships, as instrumental toward some other goal. they’re networking so they can make money or trying to find a romantic partner so they can make certain lifestyle changes. while i’m certainly interested in making money and forming serious relationships, i don’t view queening as a primarily instrumental endeavor. conversely, queening is, to me, fundamentally and inherently valuable. i believe people were born to queen. in fact, the point of money and romance and everything else is to facilitate queening. when i go to bed at night and think about my day, if i queened, i can be satisfied on some level. even in the absence of money, clout, expression, and grifting, queening is usually sufficient to feel like life is worth living. i don’t really feel that queening out will ever be taken from me until i’m dead.</p>

  <h2>level 2: having money</h2>
  <p>i understand all problems in my life as money problems. i don’t think i would really consider myself to have any real problems if i had money except for maybe one existential insecurity that cannot be adequately resolved. i have had enough money to say, live a frugal lifestyle for a year without needing income, which affords me some freedom, but comes with the threat that i will not have money in a short period of time. the times when i have money, i usually use it to buy freedom rather than letting it compound. this is something i need to change in order to transcend. the most powerful force of money on the psyche is that it makes you understand value across time. the trade-off is roughly “do i enjoy my life now or give myself a chance to enjoy it later?” you either allow yourself freedom in order to enjoy your life in the present, or you spend time doing things you don’t want to do, hoping that you can use the money you earn from doing unsavory activities to experience freedom and enjoy your life in the future. my relationship to money is pretty bad because i have never enjoyed any income-generating activities. it’s genuinely unclear to me whether this is abnormal because i can never tell if people are lying when they say they like their jobs.</p>

  <h2>level 3: clout and posting</h2>
  <p>clout and posting are forms of one-way or imbalanced queening. they entail the pursuit of influence and make the benefits of queening and having money public. in a sense, tiers one and two are maintenance, and tiers three and four are expression. the best and most satisfying moments in my life have all resulted from making something that’s revealing or honest or lowkey brave and then people reacting positively to it or telling me how and why it meant something to them. it could be writing a book or throwing a party or making a banging tweet. it’s important to me to influence people and i feel like i am relatively influential within certain social circles, but i have never felt that i had enough clout or made enough things to have transcended this tier. it’s incredibly difficult to make progress in this tier if i don’t have money because of the mental state that being poor invokes.</p>

  <h2>level 4: grifting</h2>
  <p>i use the word grifting quite liberally. here, grifting has to do with the flywheel effects of money and clout-farming, which is based on the idea that grifting describes a category of economic activity with a particularly good risk:reward profile. i have friends who have hit terminal velocity on clout and money and can just basically slap their name on stuff or throw money around and it gets interpreted as them doing things and being important. it usually takes a lot of effort and luck to get to this point but then the clout and capital flywheel just continues with some light maintenance. they generally just get to enjoy their lives without any significant coercion. i have never experienced this, but it’s the pinnacle of the hierarchy of needs because it seems so secure to be in a place where you don’t really have to do much to “progress” and it becomes kind of your default state.</p>

  <p>in summary, queening makes life worth it at an extremely basic level, money makes it enjoyable, clout makes it feel important, and grifting makes it all easier so that nothing can stop you from incessantly queening without limits.</p>

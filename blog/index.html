  <h2>level 1: queening out</h2>
  <p>i realized recently that a lot of my friends frame social activity, especially forming new relationships, as instrumental toward some other goal. they’re networking so they can make money or trying to find a romantic partner so they can make certain lifestyle changes. while i’m certainly interested in making money and forming serious relationships, i don’t view queening as a primarily instrumental endeavor. conversely, queening is, to me, fundamentally and inherently valuable. i believe people were born to queen. in fact, the point of money and romance and everything else is to facilitate queening. when i go to bed at night and think about my day, if i queened, i can be satisfied on some level. even in the absence of money, clout, expression, and grifting, queening is usually sufficient to feel like life is worth living. i don’t really feel that queening out will ever be taken from me until i’m dead.</p>

  <h2>level 2: having money</h2>
  <p>i understand all problems in my life as money problems. i don’t think i would really consider myself to have any real problems if i had money except for maybe one existential insecurity that cannot be adequately resolved. i have had enough money to say, live a frugal lifestyle for a year without needing income, which affords me some freedom, but comes with the threat that i will not have money in a short period of time. the times when i have money, i usually use it to buy freedom rather than letting it compound. this is something i need to change in order to transcend. the most powerful force of money on the psyche is that it makes you understand value across time. the trade-off is roughly “do i enjoy my life now or give myself a chance to enjoy it later?” you either allow yourself freedom in order to enjoy your life in the present, or you spend time doing things you don’t want to do, hoping that you can use the money you earn from doing unsavory activities to experience freedom and enjoy your life in the future. my relationship to money is pretty bad because i have never enjoyed any income-generating activities. it’s genuinely unclear to me whether this is abnormal because i can never tell if people are lying when they say they like their jobs.</p>

  <h2>level 3: clout and posting</h2>
  <p>clout and posting are forms of one-way or imbalanced queening. they entail the pursuit of influence and make the benefits of queening and having money public. in a sense, tiers one and two are maintenance, and tiers three and four are expression. the best and most satisfying moments in my life have all resulted from making something that’s revealing or honest or lowkey brave and then people reacting positively to it or telling me how and why it meant something to them. it could be writing a book or throwing a party or making a banging tweet. it’s important to me to influence people and i feel like i am relatively influential within certain social circles, but i have never felt that i had enough clout or made enough things to have transcended this tier. it’s incredibly difficult to make progress in this tier if i don’t have money because of the mental state that being poor invokes.</p>

  <h2>level 4: grifting</h2>
  <p>i use the word grifting quite broadly. here, grifting has to do with the flywheel effects of money and clout-farming, which is based on the idea that grifting describes a category of economic activity with a particularly good risk:reward profile. i have friends who have hit terminal velocity on clout and money and can just basically slap their name on stuff or throw money around and it gets interpreted as them doing things and being important. it usually takes a lot of effort and luck to get to this point but then the clout and capital flywheel just continues with some light maintenance. they generally just get to enjoy their lives without any significant coercion. i have never experienced this, but it’s the pinnacle of the hierarchy of needs because it seems so secure to be in a place where you don’t really have to do much to “progress” and it becomes kind of your default state.</p>

  <p>in summary, queening makes life worth it at an extremely basic level, money makes it enjoyable, clout makes it feel important, and grifting makes it all easier so that nothing can stop me from incessantly queening until the end of time.</p>

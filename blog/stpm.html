  <h2>Full Account</h2>

  <p>
    The following is an account of the end of Scroll Tax and my friendship with Kayla. I share this version with people who want more context beyond the basic timeline.
  </p>

  <p>
    In preparation for launching a narrative studio with a collaborator, I circulated a short, intentionally abstract manifesto to fewer than ten people. I shared it in a group chat with Kayla and our mutual friend Maddie. After reading it, Kayla and Maddie accused me of (1) creating a project that competed with Scroll Tax and (2) taking a startup idea that Maddie had ideated.
  </p>

  <p>
    I immediately offered to talk through these accusations privately. I asked for clarification and made clear that nothing was public yet and that any legitimate issues could be resolved before launch. I explained that the narrative studio would not do public-facing work or video media and therefore would not compete with Scroll Tax or interfere with my participation in it. I also explained that the idea Maddie accused me of taking was a technical AI product, whereas what I was building was a communications and narrative studio. Neither accusation was clarified, defended, or substantiated.
  </p>

  <p>
    Instead, Maddie escalated the accusations to a group chat that included multiple industry figures, using accusatory language and asking me to explain myself. Kayla supported the accusations in that setting while continuing to refuse private conversation. At that point, it became clear that the discussion was no longer oriented toward resolution. The incentives had shifted toward reputational positioning.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the group chat, Kayla made moral judgments about my integrity while declining to engage with the substance of what I had actually done. She did not explain why the accusations were true, instead asserting that they were true and publicizing her judgments.
  </p>

  <p>
    Shortly after, Kayla removed me from a group chat with a Scroll Tax partner and told me she intended to cancel our shared Airbnb in Cannes, where we were supposed to fulfill Scroll Tax contracts together. I told her that, under those conditions, I would not proceed with filming content unless we had a direct conversation about the accusations. It was not reasonable for me to collaborate, generate footage, and hand it off for editing while being accused in a group chat and excluded from partner communications.
  </p>

  <p>
    At that point, Kayla purported to hold these positions simultaneously:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>that she was too uncomfortable to communicate with me about the accusations, despite my repeated offers to do so on her terms</li>
    <li>that she was too uncomfortable to share housing in Cannes</li>
    <li>that I was still obligated to show up and film content with her</li>
    <li>that she did not need to defend or justify the accusations she had made in front of uninvolved parties</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    She also stated that she expected me to film with her, but did not plan to let me have any of the money from the contracts. In practice, this meant she could make unaddressed accusations, cut me off from partners, take all the proceeds from contracts secured under a joint brand, and still expect me to collaborate as if nothing had happened.
  </p>

  <p>
    Kayla then initiated a “negotiation” to wind down Scroll Tax in a group chat. I told her she could keep the remaining funds in the Scroll Tax wallet and offered to let her complete the Cannes contracts without me, but asked that they not be completed under the Scroll Tax name. She went to Cannes, used Scroll Tax branding and equipment anyway, completed the contracts, and kept the proceeds. She later asked if she could post the content on the Scroll Tax X account, which I agreed to, as the brand had already been used without my approval.
  </p>

  <p>
    Later, through conversations with mutual friends, I learned that Kayla may have had unresolved issues with the labor distribution of Scroll Tax. This explanation made more sense to me than the original accusations, which were never substantiated. We had discussed labor imbalance openly in the past, and I was not shy about the fact that Kayla did more operational work. At the time of the conflict, we were actively discussing equity and revenue splits, and I had been the last person to advance that conversation. If labor distribution had been the core issue, there were established ways to address it, but it was never presented to me as a problem.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the months that followed, Kayla did not respond to my outstanding offer to talk. I later learned that she had expressed anger toward a mutual friend for spending time with me, and that Maddie had engaged in behavior that further contributed to social division. Months after that, I was told that Kayla had asked a mutual friend about becoming friends with me again.
  </p>

  <p>
    Throughout this situation, Kayla made serious accusations, declined to explain or resolve them, escalated them, and then avoided direct communication. While I remain open to discussing the situation with her and working toward resolution, I believe it is reasonable to share a complete account when people ask, particularly given that the conflict was taken to a group chat involving third parties.
  </p>

  <p>
    I am not proud of everything I said or did during this conflict. However, I believe I acted in good faith: I was open where she was closed, willing to talk where she avoided conversation, and focused on resolution rather than managing appearances. My goal in sharing this is not to escalate conflict, but to make the record clear.
  </p>

  <p>
    I am happy to discuss this situation with anyone who has questions, and to clarify any points in this account. I am also willing to provide additional context or documentation where appropriate. My preference has always been for direct, good-faith conversation and resolution.

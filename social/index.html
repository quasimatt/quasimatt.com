    <p id="baldanders" data-date="101625" data-type="social">i do a bunch of errands such as going to the dmv and then being sent to a different dmv building and then going to the ups store to print a document and then going back to the dmv. i meet <a href="https://x.com/arbitragegoth">john</a> on pike street and go to blade study for the opening of baldanders, an exhibition of andrew woolbright’s work where he larps as various artists and allegedly makes art of the people who come in. he is doing a performance of cleaning the gallery when i arrive. <a href="https://x.com/mayechkins">maya</a> arrives since she is into art and things like that. we queen out for a bit and then i stop at my apartment and take the train to bushwick. on the train i think about the exhibition and read the description which basically says that critics and people who say stuff are essentially sculptors of discourse (a phenomenon that the art aims to literalize). it’s supposed to invite people to consider that we make and use models or sculptures of the world when discoursing. to me, it’s giving social science and economics because, to me, everything gives social science and economics. i arrive at <a href="https://x.com/afflictedgirl">maisy</a>’s apartment to sculpt discourse through a friendship-based art form called changa. <a href="https://x.com/afflictedgirl">maisy</a>, <a href="https://x.com/f4eth">kathy</a>, <a href="https://x.com/_casscore">cass</a>, and <a href="https://x.com/augustaghast">august</a> are gathered in the dining room discussing changa. we sit down to begin reviving and popularizing a social mode that has recently seemed to wane in popularity: queening out. <a href="https://x.com/davidy_llc">david</a> joins us and uses his laptop. i put all my pumpkin items on the table and we eat some of them as well as some kiwi berries. we spend a lot of time creating the chica mob commandments. this exercise requires us to explore our worldviews and moralities together. we discuss ways to make chica mob quarterly sexual. i walk to the train listening to the bladee remix of pinkpantheress’s song stateside over and over. i synergize my experiences creating and consuming art and consider that art is an experience—a way of encountering something—and we just call objects art because it’s easier. when we create art objects, we pretend that an object can instantiate or embody a particular experience, but (especially in high or conceptual art) its context facilitates the experience rather than the object itself. it’s often the case that the art object could be anything and the words and people that surround it and interact with it are what actually matter. making these objects is an attempt at immortalizing an experience or trying to pass it along. as i step off the train at delancey-essex and walk to my apartment, i try to make sense of it all by thinking in exploitable meme formats. "the real art is the friends we made along the way." the real changa is getting together with the chicas and laughing hysterically at a strangely-worded sentence in <a href="https://x.com/afflictedgirl">maisy</a>’s dining room. the comics are just something we make to invite people in and convince ourselves that it could last forever. i drop my backpack off and walk through the lower east side to apartment 5 where <a href="https://x.com/_dianakris">diana</a> is having her birthday party. i queen out with <a href="https://x.com/_dianakris">diana</a>, <a href="https://x.com/hellosami">sami</a>, <a href="https://x.com/conejocapital">bunny</a>, <a href="https://x.com/wesamo__">wesam</a>, <a href="https://instagram.com/dennis___li">dennis</a>, <a href="https://x.com/ghosttyped">david</a>, <a href="https://x.com/__mihir">mihir</a>, <a href="https://x.com/colludingnode">connor</a>, <a href="https://x.com/ericwleong">eric</a>, and a bunch of other people and then they kick us out so i go home.</p>

    <p id="bluestockings" data-date="092525" data-type="social">my maintenance guy steve knocks on my door at 10:20 and fixes a number of things in my apartment including a gas leak. i walk to a woke bookstore called bluestockings that recently closed. i go because there was online drama about it because it's "employee-owned" but the legal owners or the people on the lease or something like that shut it down and changed the locks. after encountering so many posts using long paragraphs of woke language to explain and influence the situation, i dedicated myself to attending the press conference that some of the worker-owners were having. i arrive holding my umbrella in the rain to a small crowd of community members and a couple journalists. we are outside because the doors to the bookstore have been locked. a few people speak about how important the space was because you could get water there and hang out and they did mutual aid. <a href="https://x.com/f4eth">kathy</a> arrives to join me. she smokes a cigarette and gets some strange looks but no one tells her to stop. we can hardly hear what the speakers are saying because they are wearing masks and speaking kind of softly into a microphone attached to a very small speaker. they are disappointed in the legal owners of the business because they feel that they were not given an opportunity to navigate the mismatch between the leftist political goals of the space and the reality of operating a business with a monthly rent of $12,000. while they're speaking, some women wearing lululemon and a guy in business casual part the crowd to enter the apartment building above the bookstore. a guy drinking a guayaki yerba mate nods as the speakers reminisce on all the mutual aid they did in the space. when the speakers open the mic up to questions and comments from the general audience, <a href="https://x.com/f4eth">kathy</a> and i leave because we can't really hear much anyway. we walk to georgie's cafe and bar. i get a cold brew and <a href="https://x.com/f4eth">kathy</a> gets a hot coffee with almond milk and then we split some sandwiches. <a href="https://x.com/f4eth">kathy</a> discusses eating and not eating. we discuss sexual fantasy and erotica and determine that <a href="https://x.com/f4eth">kathy</a> should go to japan to do gender studies. we do a brief brandstorm for <a href="https://x.com/f4eth">kathy</a>, which is fixated on her temporarily rebranding to embrace the aesthetic of a hot girl that is chill and posts pictures of small meals. she thinks this is a huge pivot from her current brand but i explain to her that it’s actually a slight and accessible deviation. the mental mood board she develops is fixated on the idea of eating half of a grapefruit and having a cigarette. she shows me pictures of women who fit the vision and we consider some edits she can make to the way she presents herself in order to appeal to her consensually abusive boyfriend <a href="https://x.com/thesoberthug">sargent</a>. we stand on the street and i tell <a href="https://x.com/f4eth">kathy</a> that a person was recently killed at the very intersection we're standing in and then she takes the train to bushwick and i walk home. i take the train to <a href="https://instagram.com/itsissa_xo">isabella</a>’s apartment and we catch up and i use her $500 ice machine which has the ice pellets that people associate with the fast food chain sonic. we go to a restaurant called risbo and our friend <a href="https://x.com/AnjaliPatilCBS">anjali</a> meets and there and i spend $37 on some chicken, mashed potatoes, greens, cobbler, and a mocktail. we go back to <a href="https://instagram.com/itsissa_xo">isabella</a>’s apartment to queen out and then we watch the first episode of a show called the hunting wives which is kind of everything. we discuss various dramas as well as justin bieber. i text a couple group chats to see if anyone wants to hang out but everyone is at home being normal so i go home on the train and am normal and then go to bed.</p>

    <p id="saa" data-date="092225" data-type="social">i wake up on <a href="https://x.com/__mihir">mihir</a>’s couch because i got addicted to and obsessed with watching gordon ramsey’s kitchen nightmares on his projector the night before because it’s really dramatic and interesting and because i couldn’t get myself to want to go to the forever magazine party at night club 101. <a href="https://x.com/__mihir">mihir</a> says good morning to me, which he seems to think is subversive. i ask him for $2 and he gets up to give it to me but then i realize i have coins at home so i don’t actually need the $2 and i made him get out of his bed which is actually a mat on the floor for basically no reason. i put my garlic parmesan deli style pretzel chips in my backpack and go to a coffee shop near his apartment called prima brooklyn and purchase a cheddar chive biscuit and a 16 oz drip coffee for a total of $11.80 after my tip which is sizable both because i’m a good person and because i am amused by the extent to which the barista fits the nonbinary barista stereotype and the way she/they queened out with me at the register because she/they wasn’t/weren’t overwhelmingly warm but turned it up for me in comparison to other customers likely do to some sort of queer solidarity. i walk to the c train at the clinton-washington avenue stop and ride the c train and then transfer to the f train at the jay street-metrotech station and then frantically drink my coffee and burn my tongue a little bit at the station because it was dripping on the train because the lid doesn’t fit properly and then ride the f train to east broadway and walk to my apartment building. when i reach my apartment building, i unlock the door, walk up the stairs, and then unlock the door to my unit and enter it before turning around and closing the door. at my apartment, i sit at my desk and finish the coffee and eat the biscuit and grab eight quarters from my change bowl because i need $2 because i have $37 in cash but i know that my laundry will cost $39 because i dropped it off yesterday and was given a receipt that listed the price as $39. i walk to the laundromat to give the attendant $39 for my laundry but it’s not done yet so i walk back home and text <a href="https://x.com/xorkiki">kiki</a> to make sure she is still going to the famed bushwick coworking and vibing space scott avenue associates, more commonly known as saa, at noon. i take a shower and engage in other daily preparatory and maintenance activities such as using garnier fructis hair filler + ceramide color repair shampoo and garnier fructis hair filler + ceramide color repair conditioner and donning my black aritzia socks, coogi jean shorts, and black u.s. polo association polo that i got for my birthday the previous year while listening to music by one of my favorite artists, a.g. cook, including some tunes from his project with finn keane, thy slaughter. i pour myself a nice stok un-sweet black cold brew coffee with a splash of fairlife 2% reduced fat ultra-filtered milk and a large ice cube. i sip it through a plastic straw while consuming online content on platforms such as x, instagram, and tiktok on my iphone 15 and eat a peanut butter banana dark chocolate kind bar and four small cucumbers, which i dip in roasted red pepper hummus. i water the caladium postman joyner plant in my windowsill and put my airpods in and shuffle bladee’s album cold visions and then leave my apartment to catch the m15 bus at allen street and grand street. a gay guy sits near me on the bus. i ride the m15 to 1st avenue and east 14th street, where i get off of it and then cross 14th street to enter the platform of the l train and get on the next l train that is going to brooklyn. on the train there is a man wearing a baseball hat that says "joyful noise" and crying and using his phone with a black jansport backpack in his lap. i ride the l train to the jefferson avenue stop in bushwick while writing in the notes app on my iphone 15 and then i get off of it. i see a large mural advertising an album for an all-male k-pop group. i walk to the coworking and vibing space in a warehouse called the scott avenue associates which is more commonly known as saa.  i tell the person working the front desk that i’m visiting my friend <a href="https://x.com/xorkiki">kiki</a> because i’m visiting my friend <a href="https://x.com/xorkiki">kiki</a>. i go to the lounge on the fifth floor and <a href="https://x.com/xorkiki">kiki</a> gives me a tour. we discuss some topics and subjects for a while and then i pose a menu-related question to <a href="https://x.com/xorkiki">kiki</a>: what is the difference between a matcha and a matcha latte? we are unsure so we ask an saa employee and he explains that the matcha latte has steamed milk. a girl sitting near us recommends that i get a drink called "obsession" so i get it. it's good but not worth $10. i see <a href="https://x.com/yat_es">charlie</a> on the other side of the room and wave but go unseen. <a href="https://x.com/clay_devlin">clay</a> walks by and joins us and shows me a really interesting app he is making on his phone which involves some art that he made. we discuss some crypto related topics and then <a href="https://x.com/yat_es">charlie</a> says hi and gives me insider information about some upcoming events. <a href="https://x.com/mayechkins">maya</a> walks by and joins us for a while and we discuss our current projects but she finds us to distracting and leaves us in favor of locking in. i receive a message from terence on instagram warning me that saa is "a front for an elaborate israeli money laundering operation originating from happier grocer." <a href="https://x.com/clay_devlin">clay</a> clarifies that the money laundering operation is actually run by saudis and that the new york times has an article about it. i meet <a href="https://x.com/clay_devlin">clay</a>’s friend jonathan. <a href="https://x.com/joshqharris">josh</a> and <a href="https://instagram.com/_bradenm_">braden</a> stop by for one minute. i begin using software products such as chatgpt and github and overleaf to organize and understand information as well as work on projects. jonathan tells me that i should use vscode and cline and openrouter for my ai coding grifts so i set that up without doing any research about alternatives because he seems to know what he's talking about and is giving coder. <a href="https://x.com/rhynotic">adam</a> and <a href="https://instagram.com/pitter_patter_">levi</a> pull up. <a href="https://x.com/xorkiki">kiki</a> and i go to the roof and sit by the pool. we consume a grilled cheese sandwich with kimchi on it before going back to the saa lounge and queening with <a href="https://x.com/mayechkins">maya</a> for a while near a large window. saa starts giving out free spritzes to everyone in the lounge but i'm not consuming alcohol so i get an alcohol-free spritz. once i get the spritz, i drink it. i take the elevator from the 5th floor to the 1st floor in order to exit the building. i walk and take public transportation to get to my apartment and then i enter my apartment. i make two tiktoks at my desk. i work on some stuff. i go to bed.</p>

    <p id="rueyi" data-date="012724" data-type="mention">i discover a <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@rue.yi/video/7447406629793975558">tiktok by rue.yi</a> that mentions <a href="https://quasimatt.com">quasimatt.com</a>. i consider reviving <a href="https://quasimatt.com">quasimatt.com</a> in approximately its previous form.
    <p id="expained" data-date="011425" data-type="post">to close out the previous era of <a href="https://quasimatt.com">quasimatt.com</a> i'm gonna explain some stuff and discuss some topics related to its emergence and existence. i decided one day that i needed to write and publish something basically every day in order to start to think of myself as someone who makes things. that was the catalyst for having a writing project. my entire personality and worldview was developed by consuming <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/reyhan/young-cooland-into-online-influence-metrics">young klout gang</a> content as a young teen, and i think "group influencing" or the performance of friendship is the most important and interesting way to make media now. this has kind of always been a part of art and media but got really popular when k-pop, rap collectives, influencer houses, and stuff like that popped off. i talked about this a little bit in an <a href="https://themimeticinquirer.substack.com/p/quasimatt">interview</a> with <a href="https://twitter.com/kev_esh">kevin</a>'s <a href="https://themimeticinquirer.substack.com">the mimetic inquirer</a>. i like the idea of performing friendship or at least social dynamics in this way, and i aimed to lean into that with the site. i have a couple method-based books, which are no longer printed, but are related to the site in that when writing them, i was more concerned with following a set of rules than with creating a specific product that has a certain effect on the reader. the first was a recording of as many detached thoughts as i could over a month-long period that got re-organized by theme. it's called <a href="https://quasimatt.me/notabstraction">it's not abstraction it's literally just lying</a>. the second was written in one sitting with a concept of a plan and a very loose narrative theme (losing a cube) and is called <a href="https://quasimatt.me/cube">i lost my cube</a>. i had a now-deleted blog a long time ago called no backspace where i would write really really fast without pressing backspace ever. in my first book, there is a passage that's about this idea that it can be easier to say something revealing or vulnerable to everyone than it is to say it to one person. when you say something to one person, there is kind of this implied demand that they respond in a certain way or at least pressure for them to be appropriately attentive or responsive. when you say something online or on a stage, you're not asking anyone to respond, but you are allowing them to if they so choose. the guise of trying to be entertaining or clout farming or performing can allow you to be more open in a certain type of way, which is one of the main reasons i find the performance of social dynamics cool or perhaps even useful. one time a few years ago i got on a livestream with my friend and clocked them into oblivion about something i had been wanting to bring up to them for months and i didn't even think about it because now that we were performing our relationship to an audience and i could just say "oh i was doing conflict for engagement or interest." this is clearly not indicative of a healthy and communicative relationship but like i'm toxic so that's how it played out. anyway i have always wanted to do what i call a "brain reveal" by writing and i have said things publicly by tweeting and writing that i would never say to someone individually because it would feel like i was being a burden or a nuisance. <a href="https://quasimatt.com">quasimatt.com</a> was more of a social life reveal than a brain reveal but it's all related. the first <a href="https://quasimatt.com">quasimatt.com</a> post was me going to a bunch of parties in rapid succession, and culminated with a cloutbomb picnic hosted by <a href="https://twitter.com/matthdonovan">matthew donovan</a> with a bunch of names on the flyer. the social group at this picnic was really the impetus for <a href="https://quasimatt.com">quasimatt.com</a> in the sense that the core idea that lists are art is ripped from extremely online downtown new york culture and dimes square. when i started engaging with readings and parties in this scene, it was immediately clear to me that it was absolutely not important what happened at these events. they were the most normal gatherings of friends you could have. what was important was who was on the flyer and who was mentioned in the reading and who wrote about it and who got mentioned. the social scene was always talked about as being intertwined with art and a lot of the people who hung around these places would go to art galleries and write a substack and take pictures and do things that could be considered artistic. the main criticism of this social scene, since i have engaged with it, has been that there is no identifiable and good artistic production. well actually i guess the main criticism is that it's fascist. but besides that. to me the absence of an art object was and is extremely the point. like literally the point is that it was a group of people who really don't have much access to the actual high art scene who performed the social dynamics of an art scene (and anyone who has been around knows that these dynamics are very clearly performed in hopes they will be written about or memed about by someone). this concept not only eats but slays as well because in high art a lot of the point of all of it is to create an art object which acts as an investment vehicle. the object is just a physical representation of social dynamics. art becomes valuable because of its lore: what is the story of the artists development? what ideas is the work associated with? what do critics and academics and other people of clout say about it? who does the artist hang out with? who else owns art from the same artist? in which galleries has this artist's art appeared? even things like where the artist went to school are clout indicators. so these people are just doing all that art world shit but without the object. it's like an admission of something (the clout-centric, social nature of art) that is obfuscated in the respectable or legitimate art world, which giga-larps that the art object itself is actually important. there are obviously other things going on with all that but this was the interesting part to me. anyway, it seemed like the easiest, no-frills way of leaning into this dynamic of doing stuff to be written about and lore-building was to literally make what is essentially a list of people present at an event with maybe a brief description of important events as art because the actual ideologically or artistically meaningful products of dimes square (which are often not recognized as such) are literally lists of names on party flyers, memes, and substacks like <a href="https://mcrumps.substack.com">crumpstack</a> and <a href="https://kathypill.substack.com">kathypill</a>. <a href="https://quasimatt.com">quasimatt.com</a>, was about my life, not exclusively this social scene, but it draws a lot of inspo from it and i was clearly engaging with that stuff for a while. also, i wanted to remember people's names and have an excuse to find them on social media to make my life easier and be more popping so that was a big part of it as well. so basically <a href="https://quasimatt.com">quasimatt.com</a> was based on like a bunch of ideas and follows a really genius artistic legacy.</p>
    <p id="eulogy" data-date="011425" data-type="other"><a href="https://quasimatt.com">quasimatt.com</a> has been and is a place for me to post. while it has previously focused on other people and even included some links to other people's social media profiles, i will now be focused on myself. it was lowkey interesting to do all that and i'm really into method-based writing so it was cool to set the rules and follow them even when it was annoying, but it also led to some weird stuff like me getting on my phone in the middle of a party to record people's names and it was always annoying to farm everyone's social media profiles. at times people were genuinely annoyed with me for asking for like 10 people's social media profiles and making them do social research. i will be maintaining the straightforward tone because it's the only way i really know how to write except like academic writing. i will also maintain the lack of editing or concern with structure both because i'm lazy and because i think it's more interesting to read what people say when they just say it instead of trying to maximize its effectiveness or curate their words a lot. i'm not exactly sure what will happen on here these days but i am glad you read it. and if anyone has ideas for <a href="https://quasimatt.com">quasimatt.com</a> i would genuinely like to hear them. i have some ideas but it's easier when other people just come up with really genius ideas so i don't have to. i am considering getting on a radical openness type beat but it's really scary and hard to do that so i might not. if you appeared on <a href="https://quasimatt.com">quasimatt.com</a> v1, thank you for being in my life in whatever way over the past few months. some of you were annoying but most of you were chill and cool and it was a fun little era. some of the extremely hypersocial periods i had over the past year or so were among the best periods of my life so far. don't cry because it's over. cry because it's actually just different instead of being over. love and light!</p>

to <a href="https://twitter.com/bea_pam_a">pam</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/kev_esh">kevin</a>, who is installing lights and artwork on the walls. i take a look at the art. it's easily my favorite art that <a href="https://twitter.com/kev_esh">kevin</a> has made. it's about his brother but the imagery is vague and nostalgic. it feels like i'm being prompted with a vibe or idea and asked to finish the work off. it makes me think about youth and brotherhood and family and leisure and friendship. i talk to <a href="https://twitter.com/emailyedelman">emily</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/adamberninger">adam</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/aurecevettier">paul</a>. <a href="https://twitter.com/kev_esh">kevin</a>'s mom comes around and introduces herself, offering us some oreos. she talks about the art's impact on her and its aesthetic qualities and tells us that their family refers to <a href="https://twitter.com/kev_esh">kevin</a>'s career/behavior/vibe as <a href="https://twitter.com/kev_esh">kevin</a>ology. <a href="https://twitter.com/haiverart">haiver</a> arrives and <a href="https://twitter.com/emailyedelman">emily</a> introduces me to <a href="https://twitter.com/mccoyspace">kevin</a>, who <a href="https://twitter.com/kev_esh">kevin</a> later tells me invented the nft or minted the first nft or something like that. i talk to <a href="https://instagram.com/johngh93">john</a> and jeremy, who tells me about some extremely esoteric film he's doing a project with that requires him to travel to lots of national parks and snap pics. i tell <a href="https://twitter.com/kev_esh">kevin</a> i have to blast because i'm flying to bali the next day and he asks if i'm seeing moo deng. i tell his that i do have plans to see moo deng. in fact, my only plan for my asia trip is to see moo deng. i don't know where i'm staying or when i'm leaving bali. i have a plane ticket to bali and a confirmed rsvp to a moo deng meet and greet. i go to mala project and have a meal with <a href="https://twitter.com/ktrivs">kayla</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/gabriellemic">gab</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/nogoodtwts">keeks</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/mashahealy">masha</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/sodofi_">sophia</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/amelia_guertin">amelia</a>. i meet <a href="https://twitter.com/selfimmolati0n">dull</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/escbas">bienstock</a> near the roxy cinema. we walk to the roxy and sit with <a href="https://twitter.com/rantoninretaud">charley</a>, <a href="https://instagram.com/textilecone">annabel</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/damianaureli">justin lapuff</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/unbridled_id">sierra</a> at a table outside. we're all here to see <a href="https://rachelormont.com">www.rachelormont.com</a>, a film by <a href="https://instagram.com/themasterofcum">peter vack</a>. <a href="https://twitter.com/dogwhistl3">darias</a> pulls up and then <a href="https://instagram.com/themasterofcum">peter</a> himself arrives for a moment. <a href="https://twitter.com/donotdelay">ariel</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/nonpoccafe">salty</a> pull up. we go inside and i talk to <a href="https://instagram.com/highwaysnobbery">jack</a> for a bit and then <a href="https://twitter.com/maroon6fan">kyle</a> and <a href="https://instagram.com/billypedlow">billy</a>. it's hot as hell and the film starts really late but it's good and interesting and about the internet and celebrity and micro-celebrity and clout and attention and memes and advertising and being a character and being a person and edgelording and it features <a href="https://twitter.com/rantoninretaud">charley</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/escbas">bienstock</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/wolktress">ivy</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/dash_eats">dasha</a> and <a href="https://instagram.com/me_betseybrown">betsey</a> and <a href="https://instagram.com/themasterofcum">peter</a>'s parents and it's about memes and it's so much more edgelord-online-dimes-square-downtown-scene-core than i thought it would be. the core idea and plot is good enough to stand on its own without necessarily referencing a bunch of specific things like milady and treblinka and <a href="https://twitter.com/dash_eats">dasha</a> but it just references milady and treblinka and <a href="https://twitter.com/dash_eats">dasha</a> anyway. it depicts social media profiles as theatrical performances where the followers are in the audience and the poster is on the stage. it depicts someone who is a radical consumer of the internet becoming a poster, being taken advantage of, being trolled, meeting her idols, and falling apart, finding comfort in the same gross consumptive cycle that caused her problems. it's extremely dark. it makes me uncomfortable. the film ends and there is a question and answer session where there are some normal questions and some "i need you to know that i'm aware of your work" questions and then a question about the sex scene in the film and whether <a href="https://instagram.com/themasterofcum">peter</a> has any concern about how it will influence the potential for wide distribution of the film. <a href="https://instagram.com/themasterofcum">peter</a> has been occasionally lightly bullying the question askers throughout the q&a session but he really bullies the person who asks this question and seems to take the question as a critique. its unclear to me whether <a href="https://instagram.com/themasterofcum">peter</a> is trying to communicate that the art is made without concern for distribution or whether he just doesn't really think the sex scene will impact distribution or he's never thought about it or he doesn't give a fuck. all i can really tell is that he's mad. or maybe he's not even mad. maybe he's trolling. maybe he's controversymaxxing. maybe he's doing something that people will write about. you can never be sure what's going on around here. the session ends and i go to the deli with <a href="https://twitter.com/rantoninretaud">charley</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/nonpoccafe">salty</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/selfimmolati0n">dull</a>. i come back to the roxy for a little bit and talk to some other people and then leave.</p>
    <p id="sublease" data-date="100324" data-type="social">i visit my apartment to grab some stuff and talk to <a href="https://twitter.com/weymarjohansson">weyland</a> about startups and some other stuff while i'm there.</p>
    <p id="villains" data-date="100224" data-type="social">i meet <a href="https://twitter.com/weymarjohansson">weyland</a> in washington square park to give him my keys since he's subleasing my extremely luxe lower east side chinatown border studio apartment while i leave. i hand the keys off and then meet <a href="https://twitter.com/ktrivs">kayla</a> at an event to promote season two of house of villains, a reality tv show. <a href="https://twitter.com/ktrivs">kayla</a> networks and makes content and i spot <a href="https://instagram.com/oliviagdrogliano">olivia</a> which is lowkey random asf. we chat for a while and then the cast speaks. many italian americans are present at the event. we mill around and then i take a picture with <a href="https://instagram.com/tiffany_hbic_pollard">tiffany "new york" pollard</a>, the inventor of culture and controversy. <a href="https://twitter.com/ktrivs">kayla</a> and i get our free hats on the way out and sit in the park for a while before taking the train home.</p>
    <p id="ketamine" data-date="100124" data-type="social"><a href="https://twitter.com/f4eth">kathy</a> invites me to create a chica zone near my apartment but she comes over to turn my apartment into a chica zone instead. we hang out all day and then go to a desci event about ketamine. we talk to <a href="https://twitter.com/0xmikeyf">mikey</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/kyritzb">bryan</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/babybaudrillard">cassidy</a>. i talk to <a href="https://twitter.com/jerh17">yev</a> who tells me she co-founded the auditing firm hacken. i talk to <a href="https://twitter.com/realityspammer">max</a> a little bit and then sort of interact with <a href="https://twitter.com/danmancini">dan</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/neoliberalhell">neoliberalhell</a>, people who i am aware of due to their niche downtown celebrity but have never really met in like an official or real way. i meet some people and talk to <a href="https://twitter.com/kitvolta">kat</a>. <a href="https://twitter.com/0xmikeyf">mikey</a> starts introducing the event and <a href="https://twitter.com/kitvolta">kat</a> turns to me and says "this seems more interesting than other grifts." <a href="https://twitter.com/f4eth">kathy</a> reads about her experience with ketamine and gets some laughs. i record her reading and then a guy talks about some philosophical stuff related to ketamine. <a href="https://twitter.com/ikauvar">isaac</a> gives his talk, focusing on depersonalization and derealization. much of the talk is dedicated to understanding and formalizing dissociation and the conditions of the brain that cause or enable it. it's really giving science. i zone out a little bit and <a href="https://twitter.com/ikauvar">isaac</a> talks about experiments on mice. <a href="https://twitter.com/ikauvar">isaac</a> mentions that we know ketamine causes dissociation but that the billion dollar question is "why does ketamine have anti-depressive effects?" <a href="https://twitter.com/f4eth">kathy</a> says "being the self is insufferable. duh." she bites a klonopin in half and puts her headphones in and rocks out while <a href="https://twitter.com/ikauvar">isaac</a> finishes his talk. the talk is dedicated to reaching a scientific conclusion about something that is best understood through experience. nothing about the conclusions or talk is all that revealing compared to just doing ketamine recreationally and catching a vibe. people seem to really like the event, but to <a href="https://twitter.com/f4eth">kathy</a> and me it feels trivial. i meet <a href="https://twitter.com/camillenvargas">camille</a>. i talk to <a href="https://instagram.com/em.mak">emma</a> and <a href="https://instagram.com/ohappydei">afua</a>. i take the train home and meet <a href="https://instagram.com/scott-litts">scott</a>, who is going to sovereign house with some of my friends.</p>

    <p id="nacho" data-date="091924" data-type="social">i walk to 120 east broadway because <a href="https://twitter.com/oklou_">oklou</a> is having a secret show that <a href="https://twitter.com/k_compss">kyle</a> tells me about because he's on the list. i say hi to <a href="https://twitter.com/k_compss">kyle</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/michaleenultra">michael</a> who are waiting outside. i’m not on the list but <a href="https://twitter.com/oklou_">oklou</a>’s 2020 album galore has been my favorite album since its release, so i go to the front of the line and ask people if they have a +1 because the list spots were distributed with +1s for everyone. i meet <a href="https://instagram.com/tighebrary">alex</a>, who agrees to +1 me into the event. he’s from australia and moved to new york a month ago because his partner is going to school at columbia. we talk about new york and australia. we ascend the stairs to the sixth floor of the loft building and enter a room with a keyboard and some other equipment set up. we sit on some cushions. <a href="https://twitter.com/k_compss">kyle</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/michaleenultra">michael</a> join us. <a href="https://twitter.com/oklou_">oklou</a> plays a few songs, some old and some new. all of them are gorgeous and beautiful and amazing. one of them has a <a href="https://twitter.com/bladeecity">bladee</a> feature. she acts like the feature is a secret, holding up a printed picture of a silhouette with a question mark over it as a voice that obviously belongs to <a href="https://twitter.com/bladeecity">bladee</a> plays through the speaker. the show ends and <a href="https://twitter.com/michaleenultra">michael</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/k_compss">kyle</a>, <a href="https://instagram.com/tighebrary">alex</a>, and i go to time again. it’s full and the security people are corralling and harassing everyone, so we go to reception instead. <a href="https://instagram.com/tighebrary">alex</a> leaves and i enjoy a drink with <a href="https://twitter.com/k_compss">kyle</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/michaleenultra">michael</a>. we all go to north dumpling for dumplings. i buy mountain dews, slim jims, and a buzzball from the deli and call a lyft to greenpoint for <a href="https://twitter.com/clownfarm">ashley</a>’s birthday party. <a href="https://twitter.com/clownfarm">ashley</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/______4l5">annie</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/ultraslut">blake</a>, <a href="https://instagram.com/halsey.wav">david</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/ryanb______">ryan</a>, and <a href="https://instagram.com/lightrefractingintercourse">zoe</a> are there. i give <a href="https://twitter.com/clownfarm">ashley</a> 2 slim jims, 2 mountain dews, and a buzzball. <a href="https://twitter.com/______4l5">annie</a> incessantly burps and and makes jokes where she replaces the words "not your" with "nacho" for a few hours. <a href="https://instagram.com/maxwellrogan">max</a> and <a href="https://instagram.com/nigeltreinen">nigel</a> arrive. some of us go to troost, where <a href="https://twitter.com/______4l5">annie</a> reaches behind the bar to try to slap a chunk of ice into a cup, and we go to bar americano. i lyft home.</p>
    <p id="dna" data-date="091724" data-type="social">i peel myself off my couch and take a lyft to the grifter complex known as station 3 for a desci event that i'm hosting. the event is billed as a conversation with <a href="https://twitter.com/4lovofscience">josie zayner</a> about diy dna hacking. a guy scans my ticket and i walk through a labyrinth of offices and make it to the hadron office, which is packed with people who seem like they have jobs. i wade through the crowd and find <a href="https://twitter.com/griftsh0p">keegan</a>. i ask him if we have a squad here, referring to the group of people who probably have the least business being at the event and yet are listed on the flyer as hosts and djs due to their engagement with niche clout culture. i find <a href="https://twitter.com/matthdonovan">matthew</a> picking up some trash and otherwise being useful and ask him if he wants help with anything. he says no and points me toward the bar. the room is loud so i wander out into the hallway and find <a href="https://twitter.com/babybaudrillard">cassidy</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/griftsh0p"><a href="https://twitter.com/griftsh0p">keegan</a></a>, <a href="https://instagram.com/menyeleksrose">menyelek</a>, and <a href="https://instagram.com/rubysutt">ruby</a> having a chat. <a href="https://instagram.com/rubysutt">ruby</a> tells me she went to burning man. <a href="https://twitter.com/griftsh0p">keegan</a> and <a href="https://instagram.com/menyeleksrose">menyelek</a> leave to go to trivia. <a href="https://twitter.com/babybaudrillard">cassidy</a> and i talk about how we think <a href="https://twitter.com/0xmikeyf">mikey</a> is cool and interesting and i share my theory that he's a fed, but <a href="https://twitter.com/0xmikeyf">mikey</a> shows up so we have to change the topic. i say hi to <a href="https://twitter.com/0xmikeyf">mikey</a>. i meet a guy named max who immediately asks me if i'm "actually gay" after briefly acknowledging his familiarity with <a href="https://quasimatt.com">quasimatt.com</a>. <a href="https://instagram.com/mc.nz">mackenzie</a> pulls up and i chat with her for a second before <a href="https://twitter.com/selfimmolati0n">dull</a> comes. he says he needs food and water and leaves almost immediately. <a href="https://twitter.com/realityspammer">max</a> walks by. <a href="https://twitter.com/rantoninretaud">charley</a> shows up for a moment and then i go inside the event space in anticipation of the beginning of the talk. i say hit to <a href="https://instagram.com/tactileinput">gabriel</a> and run into <a href="https://twitter.com/kittystremy">kitty</a>, who is supposed to ask some questions at the end. <a href="https://twitter.com/0xmikeyf">mikey</a> gets everyone's attention and starts saying stuff about desci. <a href="https://twitter.com/4lovofscience">josie</a> tries to accelerate his introduction, starting applause early and groaning when he flips to new slides. eventually <a href="https://twitter.com/4lovofscience">josie</a> introduces herself and talks about some struggles related to being an outcast within the context of the scientific establishment. there are some technical difficulties, and the presentation begins. <a href="https://twitter.com/4lovofscience">josie</a> immediately gives the impression that she thinks of biology as an art and as a field that should invite a wide array of experimentation. she insinuates that some of the things we accomplish with other forms of tech could be more interestingly or straightforwardly accomplished through biotechnological innovation, mentioning that psychedelics are cooler than virtual reality, and that she wants to focus on making pokemon instead of making anti-body drugs. she pokes fun at medical research, saying she doesn't want to give mice cancer and then cure it, but is more interested in doing "crazy shit." my first impression of <a href="https://twitter.com/4lovofscience">josie</a> is that she is combative: combative about wanting to take over the microphone, combative about the tech issues related to her presentation, and combative about the academic environment that stifles certain kinds of research. there is a heavy thread of anti-institutionalism throughout the talk. the background music swells into something hopeful-sounding as <a href="https://twitter.com/4lovofscience">josie</a> shifts her focus to gene editing for embryos. her words no longer have an enemy, and she fixates on the possibility of gene editing to change the way we live and the importance of making biological experimentation accessible to everyone. right when i think we're getting into the core of the talk, <a href="https://twitter.com/4lovofscience">josie</a> says "biotech can't have a future without you" and announces the end of the presentation, inviting the audience to ask questions. as <a href="https://twitter.com/0xmikeyf">mikey</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/kittystremy">kitty</a> sit in chairs next to <a href="https://twitter.com/4lovofscience">josie</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/matthdonovan">matthew</a> asks me if i want to come sit with them to ask questions. i say "not really" and he returns to the stage. <a href="https://twitter.com/kittystremy">kitty</a> asks what advice <a href="https://twitter.com/4lovofscience">josie</a> has for young researchers. <a href="https://twitter.com/4lovofscience">josie</a> says not to let people tell you things are impossible. <a href="https://twitter.com/kittystremy">kitty</a> asks for <a href="https://twitter.com/4lovofscience">josie</a>'s thoughts on the endpoint or goal of biotech research: should researchers be focused on achieving certain quantitative results, or on more qualitative factors like how people feel? <a href="https://twitter.com/4lovofscience">josie</a> shares an anecdote in which she made a drug for one person and it alleviated their symptoms. the federal drug administration would not allow the dose for this person to be increased without 6 months of data. she implies that institutions are overly cautious with research and that what matters in this case is how the person feels, not creating a pool of data to justify the drug. various audience members ask questions next. when answering these questions, <a href="https://twitter.com/4lovofscience">josie</a> advises a student that a curious person likely cannot reach their goals within the confines of the academic system. she does accelerationism when someone asks about ethics, basically stating that people will continue to do scientific and technological experimentation and innovation no matter what, and emphasizes that when we leave experimentation up to governments and huge companies, it gets gatekept and sold rather than shared. <a href="https://twitter.com/4lovofscience">josie</a> wants a future in which the results of this experimentation are more widely available. <a href="https://twitter.com/0xmikeyf">mikey</a> asks a question about collaboration, and <a href="https://twitter.com/4lovofscience">josie</a> says that science should be more goal oriented and that the practice of coming up with a hypothesis and then testing it isn't ideal in many situations. scientists should have goals for what they want to make and then try to make it. an audience member asks <a href="https://twitter.com/4lovofscience">josie</a> about "crispr-ing" herself. <a href="https://twitter.com/4lovofscience">josie</a> answers by saying she's a scientist and an activist and considers much of what she does performance art. her goal in "crispr-ing" herself was to prove that someone could do it, and it was more about that than the actual biological result of the "crispr-ing." after a few more questions, <a href="https://twitter.com/4lovofscience">josie</a> reveals that various governmental bodies have come after her and scared her for her research. i wonder what research got her in trouble, and then wonder what her research entails more broadly given that the talk and the q&a session were mostly aspirational and sentimental. i realize i'm not exactly sure what <a href="https://twitter.com/4lovofscience">josie</a>'s main research is or what it accomplishes. there is talk of making a dragon and making a six-legged mammal. there are fanciful things that could be done, and i wonder what has been done. when the talk concludes, i feel pilled on experimental science, science as art, art as science, diy science, and the like, but i don't know what to do about it. similarly to the previous desci talk, i am left thinking that the goal wasn't to talk about research, but to talk about possibility and to sell an idea. i leave the event, walk to pier 17 and look at the east river for a while. i take the bus home.</p>

i walk to the venue in soho. when i get into the event space i do a lap around the bar and sit with <a href="https://twitter.com/griftsh0p">keegan</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/babybaudrillard">cass</a>. <a href="https://twitter.com/babybaudrillard">cass</a> is writing an obituary for <a href="https://twitter.com/bryan_johnson">bryan johnson</a> which she'll read before the event. <a href="https://twitter.com/rhynotic">adam</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/clay_devlin">clay</a>, and their friend <a href="https://twitter.com/briandotmchale">brian</a> find me and say hi. i talk to <a href="https://twitter.com/elizardbethc">elizabeth</a> before mingling a bit. i talk to <a href="https://twitter.com/magdajtaylor">magdalene</a>, who's there to cover the event for gq. <a href="https://twitter.com/comradesanchez">jose</a> approaches us and we chat for a bit before i continue my lap and find <a href="https://twitter.com/matthdonovan">matthew</a>, who played a role in organizing the event. <a href="https://twitter.com/matthdonovan">matthew</a> uses his clout and fame to get me a press pass so i can have all the access necessary to write my <a href="https://quasimatt.com">quasimatt.com</a> post. i go back to <a href="https://twitter.com/griftsh0p">keegan</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/babybaudrillard">cass</a>, who have been joined by <a href="https://twitter.com/damianaureli">lapuff</a>. i talk to him for a bit and am asked to be interviewed for the descinyc instagram account. the interviewer asks me why i'm there. i ineloquently say i'm not there for scientific reasons, but for more of an artistic exploration of <a href="https://twitter.com/bryan_johnson">bryan</a>'s cult leadership. i talk to <a href="https://twitter.com/mcrumps">crumps</a> and then make my way to the press-only section and sit with <a href="https://twitter.com/babybaudrillard">cass</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/griftsh0p">keegan</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/damianaureli">lapuff</a>. after some introductions, <a href="https://twitter.com/babybaudrillard">cass</a> reads her obituary for <a href="https://twitter.com/bryan_johnson">bryan</a>, which is mostly terroristic, fixating on <a href="https://twitter.com/bryan_johnson">bryan</a>'s dick and shilling <a href="https://twitter.com/selfimmolati0n">dull</a>'s upcoming party at gonzo's. <a href="https://twitter.com/babybaudrillard">cass</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/griftsh0p">keegan</a> leave, and <a href="https://twitter.com/bryan_johnson">bryan johnson</a> is shown on the screen for a live interview. toward the beginning of the conversation, i see <a href="https://twitter.com/selfimmolati0n">dull</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/basedmaterialsm">adrian</a>, and hegelian egirl <a href="https://twitter.com/returntohegel">nikki</a> across the room. during the talk, <a href="https://twitter.com/matthdonovan">matthew</a> asks a question about access to longevity treatments. <a href="https://twitter.com/bryan_johnson">bryan</a> doesn't really answer the question and seems quite unconcerned with the distribution of the benefits of the research. on the topic of being accused of "being a grifter" (his words), he says "there's no reason to listen to the opinions of any human ever." <a href="https://twitter.com/selfimmolati0n">dull</a> and i glance at each other when he says the word grifter. <a href="https://twitter.com/bryan_johnson">bryan</a> launches into an aside about how people misunderstand his project as primarily scientific when really his public-facing project is philosophical and social. his goal is to convince people that they should want to live longer and prioritize living longer and abandon the idea that death is inevitable. for much of the back and forth, the panel of question-askers from descinyc and <a href="https://twitter.com/bryan_johnson">bryan</a> seem to talk past each other. <a href="https://twitter.com/bryan_johnson">bryan</a> is concerned with creating demand for a result: longer, healthier lives. he mostly refuses to go into detail about the methodology of the research. the desci people are extremely concerned with the process of doing research and getting funding and sharing data and results. following a question about the ethical limit of advancing the health of one group at the expense of another, <a href="https://twitter.com/bryan_johnson">bryan</a> reveals a hyper-accelerationist commitment. he says he is unconcerned with ethical calculus now because the assumptions we make when doing such calculus will not be relevant assumptions in the near future. with artificial intelligence likely to expand our capacity for reasoning and significantly alter our social conditions, why should we think our paltry ethical concerns are relevant? we can offload these issue to the ai supergenius of the future! the obvious consequence of this logic is that we solve the scientific and technological problems now and worry about the distribution of the benefits and potentially harmful consequences later when we are better equipped to understand them using our 100x'ed reasoning power. i consider that the line of thinking makes sense if you assume an ai superintelligence that can solve ethical calculus problems is inevitably coming soon, but the interest that one of the richest people on earth might have in convincing the masses that they needn't worry about distribution of benefit or the negative consequences of his business on society at large is obvious. <a href="https://twitter.com/matthdonovan">matthew</a> asks a question related to the meta-analysis of longevity treatments, and <a href="https://twitter.com/bryan_johnson">bryan</a> reiterates that he's less concerned about research methods and is more concerned with creating demand for the results of the research so that people can pursue those results in whichever way they want. i realize that <a href="https://twitter.com/bryan_johnson">bryan</a>'s reason for being here is similar to mine: he's not here to talk about science. he's here for artistic reasons: to construct a narrative and ask people to identify with a movement. in his own words, to create demand. he wants to talk on a philosophical and visionary level. <a href="https://twitter.com/joshqharris">josh</a> taps me and says hi to me. <a href="https://twitter.com/bryan_johnson">bryan</a> does super based utilitarianism and talks about how cigarettes and happy meals are genocidal. he makes parting comments encouraging people to live healthier lives, emphasizing the social nature of humans and reminding us that mimicry is powerful and we should try to get people to mimic healthy behaviors. i notice that <a href="https://twitter.com/bryan_johnson">bryan</a>'s rhetoric is split into two narratives: one that is unconcerned with the immediate or near-term distribution of the benefits of his own high-impact health-related behavior (longevity research) because he assumes the problem is better solved later, and one that implies that each audience member is, at this moment, responsible for the social impact of their relatively low-impact health-related behavior (eating well, going to bed early, etc.). when the talk concludes, i'm left thinking that i sort of vibe with the radical nature of what he's doing, but am confused by the way it's communicated and moralized. as i get up from my seat and make my way toward the exit, i think that he would be better off being more straightforward about the obsessive and narrow nature of his vision rather than diluting it in a seemingly incautious way. it also occurs to me that perhaps he must give people a mandate or a responsibility in order for them to get on board with what he's doing, but i wonder why the mandate is framed primarily as socially beneficial rather than exclusively self-interested. the talk concludes and i talk to <a href="https://twitter.com/dogwhistl3">darias</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/selfimmolati0n">dull</a> before leaving the building and walking home.</p>

    <p id="normal" data-date="070224" data-type="social">on my way back from lunch i see globally famous <a href="https://twitter.com/charli_xcx">charli xcx</a> collaborator <a href="https://twitter.com/itsthedare">the dare</a> on essex street. later, i go to littlefield for <a href="https://twitter.com/mera_angelgirl">mera caulfield</a>'s comedy show "everyone is tortured, but not me. i'm normal." i'm by myself and don't know anyone there, but i see two people i recognize from the internet: <a href="https://twitter.com/wolktress">ivy wolk</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/ianisuglyyy">ian</a>. <a href="https://twitter.com/littlefucky">jill o'connell</a> hosts the show, which is opened by <a href="https://twitter.com/marleygotterer">marley gotterer</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/victoriapand">victoria pandeirada</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/mera_angelgirl">mera</a> acting out a character named hope that seems to be something like her take on a cookie monster sweatpants and rockstar energy drink girl that grew up and became a waitress. <a href="https://twitter.com/marleygotterer">marley</a> does some impressions of a cockroach with a pronoun pin, golem from lord of the rings ordering at mcdonald's, and mickey mouse gendering someone correctly for the first time ("oh... boy?"). she plays her very own <a href="https://twitter.com/boniver">bon iver</a> woods remix and performs an <a href="https://twitter.com/cheapyxomiami">azealia banks</a> remix about fucking a mormon. her performance is a highlight of the show. <a href="https://twitter.com/victoriapand">victoria</a> does a powerpoint comedy routine which i <a href="https://quasimatt.com/#frog">saw at frog farm</a>, where she tells an absurd-but-true story in which she gives sebastian bear-mcclard a one-handed vasectomy. "hope" (<a href="https://twitter.com/mera_angelgirl">mera</a> in a particularly servacious outfit) does a routine that is adapted from her recent performance at frog farm. the bit is that it's hope's first-ever comedy routine and it's funny because it's funny but also kind of funny because it's intentionally bad in a certain type of way and includes a lot of deviantart images. after a brief intermission, <a href="https://twitter.com/mera_angelgirl">mera</a> starts her main set. the highlight is a series of thought experiments where she imagines her saw trap, which is basically the most torturous situation she can possibly imagine and includes not being able to watch her boyfriend make out with <a href="https://instagram.com/jacobelordi">jacob elordi</a>. my biggest laugh of the night comes when she walks through a trolley problem in which she has to choose between killing <a href="https://instagram.com/honeymoon">lana del rey</a> when she has an amazing album in her head that has not been written or recorded or a pregnant woman. in a departure from comedy, <a href="https://twitter.com/mera_angelgirl">mera</a> reads through a children's book she wrote about a gay pirate. while the story and initial imagery are great and certainly feasible for publication, it's unclear why the reading of a serious and educational children's book is included in the show. at the end, we are all meant to watch a skit video that <a href="https://twitter.com/mera_angelgirl">mera</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/littlefucky">jill</a> made, but technical difficulties cause an unexpected intermission that lasts over 20 minutes. <a href="https://twitter.com/mera_angelgirl">mera</a> and the crowd do an impromptu acapella rendition of <a href="https://instagram.com/honeymoon">lana del rey</a>'s summertime sadness, which is just as absurd as the rest of the performance but markedly wholesome. there are some other shenanigans before the video plays and the show ends. i go home and make the website for <a href="https://instagram.com/themasterofcum">peter vack</a>'s upcoming film <a href="https://rachelormont.com">www.rachelormont.com</a>.</p>
    <p id="canadachella" data-date="070124" data-type="social">i stop at 55 fulton market for a watermelon, tortilla chips, red solo cups, and sparkling water on the way to the canadachella x <a href="https://twitter.com/quasimatt">quasimatt</a> birthday dinner hosted by <a href="https://twitter.com/ktrivs">kayla</a> in celebration of both canada day and my birthday. i meet <a href="https://twitter.com/ktrivs">kayla</a> in the lobby of her building and we go to her unit where a spread of delectable morsels is waiting for light preparation and consumption. i play some music and eat several servings of <a href="https://twitter.com/ktrivs">kayla</a>'s scrumptious homemade salsa. <a href="https://twitter.com/gabriellemic">gab</a> arrives with moka. she gives me a gift which includes a bottle of supergay vodka customized with text that repeats "<a href="https://quasimatt.com">quasimatt.com</a>" over and over and a gold bangle, which i have wanted for years but have never bought due to my constant need to larp as poor. <a href="https://twitter.com/gabriellemic">gab</a>e arrives and we go to the rooftop to grill ribs and some vegetables. <a href="https://twitter.com/conejocapital">bunny</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/tanya_smiling">tanya</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/wesamo__">wesam</a> meet us on the roof and we start eating and taking pictures of the sunset, each other, and one manhattan square. <a href="https://twitter.com/__mihir">mihir</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/abigailcarlson_">abi</a> come. <a href="https://twitter.com/abigailcarlson_">abi</a> gives me a bottle of wine. we finish our meal before <a href="https://twitter.com/ktrivs">kayla</a> and i go inside to cut the almond desert she made and serve it up to everyone. <a href="https://instagram.com/ranakittens">rana</a> arrives, completing the canadian trifecta with <a href="https://twitter.com/wesamo__">wesam</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/ktrivs">kayla</a>. she has a headband with canadian flags on it. we discuss a number of topics. <a href="https://twitter.com/__mihir">mihir</a>, <a href="https://instagram.com/ranakittens">rana</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/wesamo__">wesam</a> become incredibly fixated on drake and canada and debate the legitimacy of drake's pedophilia accusations at length. everyone leaves except for <a href="https://twitter.com/gabriellemic">gab</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/ktrivs">kayla</a>, and we stop by <a href="https://twitter.com/ktrivs">kayla</a>'s apartment where she gives me some salsa and much-needed household goods related to hydration because i once told her that i accidentally dehydrated myself half to death. <a href="https://twitter.com/gabriellemic">gab</a> and i get on the j train and go home.</p>
    <p id="gersi" data-date="063024" data-type="social">i meet <a href="https://twitter.com/conejocapital">bunny</a> at his apartment and we grab coffee at the cotton bean before going to gersi for a meal. we go back to his apartment and plan the upcoming <a href="https://twitter.com/conejocapital">bunny</a>chella. <a href="https://twitter.com/tanya_smiling">tanya</a> wakes from her slumber and joins us as we use <a href="https://twitter.com/conejocapital">bunny</a>'s dj machine (cdj or something like that) to make music sound way worse than it would if we just played it off of soundcloud. i take the train home while listening to all my favorite <a href="https://twitter.com/agcook404">a.g. cook</a> songs and then i see <a href="https://twitter.com/agcook404">a.g. cook</a> on canal street.</p>
    <p id="pirate" data-date="062924" data-type="social">i head to the <a href="https://pirate.com">pirate.com</a> studios in bushwick to meet up with <a href="https://twitter.com/blissposting">david</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/selfimmolati0n">dull</a>. <a href="https://twitter.com/selfimmolati0n">dull</a> plays a couple beats and does some brief commentary on them ("this is fire"). he turns to me and says "are you ready to see some real kings cook right now? some michelin star chefs?" and proceeds to frantically vape and scroll twitter while <a href="https://twitter.com/blissposting">david</a> works on a pop song. <a href="https://twitter.com/selfimmolati0n">dull</a> disputes a bunch of credit card charges to get some money and we leave to go to <a href="https://twitter.com/ryanbaum">ryan</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/powers26">matt</a>'s rooftop party, stopping for some hennessy and pineapple juice on the way. <a href="https://twitter.com/selfimmolati0n">dull</a> and i vibe at the party and <a href="https://twitter.com/ultraslut">blake</a> shows up. he does a dj set and then <a href="https://twitter.com/k_compss">kyle</a>, <a href="https://instagram.com/hen_arber">henry</a>, and <a href="https://instagram.com/rbirstock">rebecca</a> arrive. <a href="https://twitter.com/chill_gay_guy">jackson</a> comes a bit later. <a href="https://twitter.com/selfimmolati0n">dull</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/ultraslut">blake</a>, and i leave to go to the reading of a script that <a href="https://twitter.com/f4eth">kathy</a> is in at the new school. we take the train to the theater and <a href="https://twitter.com/f4eth">kathy</a> briefly introduces us to <a href="https://twitter.com/cavehzahedi">caveh</a>, who wrote the script, before the reading begins. i give <a href="https://twitter.com/f4eth">kathy</a> a swig of hennessy before she performs. <a href="https://twitter.com/ultraslut">blake</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/selfimmolati0n">dull</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/f4eth">kathy</a>, and i make a fun little joke about doing whippets in the auditorium. i imitate the sound of a whippet really loudly and everyone thinks i'm shushing them and goes silent. <a href="https://twitter.com/cavehzahedi">caveh</a> seizes the moment to begin the reading. the performance is difficult to understand, in part because i'm drunk, in part because it is read rather than acted, and in part because the script itself is simply difficult to understand. <a href="https://twitter.com/f4eth">kathy</a> delivers her lines in the dry and disengaged tone we've come to know and love. when the reading is over, i officially meet <a href="https://instagram.com/themasterofcum">peter vack</a> for the first time and he is normal and nice. <a href="https://twitter.com/ultraslut">blake</a> exits and <a href="https://twitter.com/selfimmolati0n">dull</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/f4eth">kathy</a>, and i go to taco bell to debrief and eat some delicious and heavily americanized mexican cuisine. we lyft to <a href="https://instagram.com/juuliacooke">julia</a>'s birthday party at gonzo's. <a href="https://twitter.com/f4eth">kathy</a> uses her clout and fame to get <a href="https://instagram.com/themasterofcum">peter</a>, who is hosting, to use his clout and fame to get us in. at first it's lowkey awkward because hardly anyone is there. we talk to annabelle before <a href="https://twitter.com/rantoninretaud">charley</a> shows up and starts screaming slurs and smoking cigarettes. throughout the night, i'm shocked by the number of people <a href="https://twitter.com/rantoninretaud">charley</a> knows. he greets almost half the party and i realize his popularity transcends my understanding. his social circles are in whole different areas. i talk to <a href="https://twitter.com/______4L5">annie</a>, meet <a href="https://instagram.com/memetides">forest</a>, and talk to <a href="https://twitter.com/nonpoccafe">salty aka michael</a> when he arrives. i do a final lap around the party and say hi to <a href="https://twitter.com/geneverwhat">gen</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/dogwhistl3">darias</a> before walking home.</p>

walk to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/themasterofcum/">vack</a>chella, which is nearby at a recording studio that becomes an events space at night called gonzo's. we use <a href="https://www.twitter.com/f4eth/">kathy</a>'s clout and fame to skip the line. i walk in and instantly see <a href="https://www.twitter.com/escbas">alex bienstock</a>, a guy that is around and knows things about art but is otherwise mysterious to me. i see <a href="https://www.twitter.com/RantoninRetaud">charley</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/BasedMaterialsm">adrian</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/babybaudrillard">cassidy</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/elizardbethc">elizabeth</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/donotdelay">ariel</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/thedayagenda">day</a> early on in the night. we all try to hang out in what we call the <a href="https://twitter.com/bladeecity">bladee</a> room, which is a room i played <a href="https://twitter.com/bladeecity">bladee</a> in all night when i hosted an arts event at gonzo's with <a href="https://www.twitter.com/blissposting">david</a>. after about 20 minutes, we get kicked out of the <a href="https://twitter.com/bladeecity">bladee</a> room because the trashy tv network bravo is filming at the party and needs to use the <a href="https://twitter.com/bladeecity">bladee</a> room as their home base. we're forced to mingle and i briefly talk to egirls <a href="https://twitter.com/______4L5">annie</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/riska9_11">riska</a>. <a href="https://twitter.com/DamianAureli">justin lapuff</a> and (obviously) <a href="https://www.instagram.com/themasterofcum">peter vack</a> are there but i don't talk to them because i have never talked to them and they are a little bit scary to me. i see <a href="https://www.twitter.com/rhynotic">adam</a>, the same guy that i saw at the previous art event, and decide to stop doing our bit and say hi to him. <a href="https://twitter.com/joshqharris">joshqharris</a>, a guy that i've been moochies with on twitter with for a while approaches me and asks the ever-scary and ever-iconic question, "are you quasimatt?" i feel really famous. i tell him that i always thought he was black because i always thought he was black, but he's actually not black. he's white. <a href="https://www.twitter.com/ultraslut/">blake</a> and <a href="https://www.twitter.com/geneverwhat/">genevieve</a> arrive with some other people from their sect of society. everyone runs around and has a bit of fun and drinks alcohol. at around midnight i get anxious about the fact that i have to work the next day and leave, seeing <a href="https://twitter.com/nobody_clothing">mark</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/griftsh0p">keegan</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/realityspammer">max</a> on the way out. when i get home, i realize i don't want to go to bed. i text <a href="https://twitter.com/conejocapital">bunny</a> "wyd these days?" because i see that he's at his apartment with <a href="https://twitter.com/abigailcarlson_">abi</a> on find my friends. he sends me a video of a spicy chick-fil-a sandwich at his apartment, and i immediately mobilize, hopping on the f train to go eat it. i eat the sandwich and hang out with <a href="https://twitter.com/conejocapital">bunny</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/abigailcarlson_">abi</a> for a bit and then go home.</p>
    <p id="fresh" data-date="060524" data-type="social">i plan to stay at home chilling and vibing but <a href="https://twitter.com/conejocapital">bunny</a> pulls up in an uber and forces me to go to wei's in williamsburg for a late dinner. we go to kidsuper because they're having an event with uniswap but it's much more of an actual party than we previously realized and we don't really want to be at a party so we try to get our friends <a href="https://twitter.com/gabriellemic">gab</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/ktrivs">kayla</a> to come out and meet us. while we wait we talk to a guy that i later find out is optimism <a href="https://twitter.com/binji_x">binji</a>. <a href="https://twitter.com/gabriellemic">gab</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/ktrivs">kayla</a> don't come out expeditiously so we walk to fresh kills to meet <a href="https://twitter.com/sowaasays">sowa</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/arbitragegoth">john</a>. right when my spine is about to shatter from contorting my body in perhaps the most uncomfortable seating arrangement known to humankind, <a href="https://twitter.com/gabriellemic">gab</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/ktrivs">kayla</a> arrive. <a href="https://twitter.com/arbitragegoth">john</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/sowaasays">sowa</a> dip and we go for a brief walk through williamsburg before going our separate ways.</p>

broadway popeye's at 12:30 and we walk to the clinton hill jimmy john's where i order a jjblt combo. it costs $18. it seems like no one wants to sell a delicious sandwich at a reasonable price these days. unemployed non-binary bushwick resident <a href="https://twitter.com/megab00f">cam</a> and employed binary bushwick resident <a href="https://twitter.com/_mun1b">munib</a> meet us at jimmy

href="https://twitter.com/JonahGraber">jonah</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/kirbyisround">brennan</a>, and a slew of their friends that i don't know. i'm rather tired so i consider going home but instead i walk to the botanical garden and get a cold brew on the way. i meet crypto founder <a href="https://twitter.com/negroprogrammer">regy</a>, crypto growth superstar <a href="https://twitter.com/html_tina">tina</a>, and crypto grifter <a href="https://twitter.com/__mihir">mihir</a> in the botanical gardens after getting a community ticket for free (life hack).

href="https://twitter.com/conejocapital">bunny</a> meets us. after we eat, i leave to stop home before going to sovereign house, a place for art-adjacent and/or crypto-adjacent and extremely online people to be performatively edgy that is often accused of being funded by rich gay guy <a href="https://twitter.com/peterthiel">peter thiel</a> and being a fascist hotbed. tonight, scene celebrity and $egirl ceo <a href="https://twitter.com/babybaudrillard">cassidy</a> is hosting her event, confessions. i'm attending because the architect of contemporary dimes square social and literary kayfabe and the inventor of culture at large, <a href="https://twitter.com/RantoninRetaud">charley</a>, is reading. i walk in and try to beeline to the back yard. on my way, i see <a href="https://twitter.com/RantoninRetaud">charley</a> and tell him i'm there just for him. he warns me that his reading is going to be "so bad." in the backyard, <a href="https://twitter.com/f4eth">kathy</a> is playing with an anime figurine, <a href="https://twitter.com/selfimmolati0n">dull</a> is being <a href="https://twitter.com/selfimmolati0n">dull</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/_casscore">cass</a> is talking to her brother, and <a href="https://twitter.com/weymarjohansson">weyland</a> and the ever-popular <a href="https://twitter.com/nonpoccafe">saltypickles</a> are milling about talking to basically every single person. after at least one million cigarettes have been smoked in the back yard, the hosts come outside and inform everyone that the reading is about to start. i go inside and sit next to <a href="https://twitter.com/f4eth">kathy</a>, who introduces me to her friend mary. <a href="https://twitter.com/DamianAureli">justin lapuff</a>, a guy who existed first as an idea and social media concept and was then embodied/co-opted by a a real actual person, reads. during the intermission, i briefly talk to <a href="https://twitter.com/babybaudrillard">cassidy</a>'s boyfriend <a href="https://twitter.com/BasedMaterialsm">adrian</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/griftsh0p">keegan</a> about not going to texas for a crypto event called consensus and going to texas for a crypto event called consensus respectively. i also talk to jeff,

href="https://twitter.com/manabovetown">nick dove</a>. i meet <a href="https://twitter.com/cibolan2000">marcel</a> irl for the first time. he identifies himself as an undercollateralized stablecoin critic and brings up rwa custodians. i do a little bit of networking and careerism. the intermission is extended by the fact that everyone is waiting for <a href="https://www.instagram.com/themasterofcum/">peter vack</a> to arrive so that he can see <a href="https://twitter.com/RantoninRetaud">charley</a>'s reading. and by everyone i mean just <a href="https://twitter.com/RantoninRetaud">charley</a> and maybe <a href="https://twitter.com/babybaudrillard">cassidy</a>. after intermission, <a href="https://twitter.com/RantoninRetaud">charley</a> reads. there are basically three things that i think would be predictable but really interesting for <a href="https://twitter.com/RantoninRetaud">charley</a> to do: address [redacted], say [redacted], and namedrop me. in his reading, <a href="https://twitter.com/RantoninRetaud">charley</a> addresses [redacted], says [redacted], and namedrops me. it's good. a girl reads a piece about wanting to fuck <a href="https://twitter.com/finkd">mark zuckerberg</a>. riding the high from the microscopic crumb of clout <a href="https://twitter.com/RantoninRetaud">charley</a> has afforded me, i rush to the exit where i see internet culture understander <a href="https://twitter.com/realityspammer">max</a>. he comments on my <a href="https://twitter.com/bladeecity">bladee</a> shirt. i walk home.</p>
    <p id="bbq" data-date="060124" data-type="social">i go to <a href="https://twitter.com/gabriellemic">gab</a>'s to barbecue and enjoy a gorgeous and amazing day in bushwick. <a href="https://twitter.com/ktrivs">kayla</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/natn3t">nat</a> are already there. we go to food bazaar and <a href="https://twitter.com/gabriellemic">gab</a> buys $350 of groceries. we cook and enjoy a delicious meal. after we eat, <a href="https://twitter.com/isabellewei">isabelle</a> and her boyfriend come. <a href="https://twitter.com/conejocapital">bunny</a> comes. we eat several pounds of meat and are all about to fall asleep, so <a href="https://twitter.com/ktrivs">kayla</a> and i take the train to manhattan, where i drop by <a href="https://twitter.com/weymarjohansson">weyland</a>'s affluent doorman loft co-op in greenwich village. <a href="https://twitter.com/selfimmolati0n">dull</a> is also there, and we discuss the state of microsubculture and our friends' lore. i go home.</p>
    <p id="dayglow" data-date="053124" data-type="social">i'm walking home from grabbing lunch at north dumpling and see <a href="https://twitter.com/charlottefang77">charlotte fang</a>-affiliated egirl <a href="https://twitter.com/waifmaterial">chloe</a> aka waifmaterial on hester street. i have an ever-so-important virtual meeting in two minutes so i just wave. we say hi and i keep it pushing. at 7 i get to bar laika in clinton hill. <a href="https://twitter.com/conejocapital">bunny</a> pulls up. digital artist and egirl <a href="https://twitter.com/kitvolta">kit</a> pulls up. <a href="https://twitter.com/__mihir">mihir</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/tayebsss">tayeb</a> meet us on the street corner but <a href="https://twitter.com/tayebsss">tayeb</a> goes home to new jersey. we uber to dayglow in bushwick to meet <a href="https://twitter.com/gabriellemic">gab</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/ktrivs">kayla</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/natn3t">nat</a>. we all go to pink metal and then tradesman. people peel off. some other things occur and transpire and we end up near myrtle broadway. the train isn't running in a timely manner so i question my entire life in the lyft home.</p>
    <p id="rod" data-date="053024" data-type="social">at noon i'm feeling restless and need to relocate so i check find my friends. i see that <a href="https://twitter.com/ktrivs">kayla</a> is at <a href="https://twitter.com/conejocapital">bunny</a>'s so i go co-work at <a href="https://twitter.com/conejocapital">bunny</a>'s palatial mansion in carroll gardens with <a href="https://twitter.com/ktrivs">kayla</a>, goated designer <a href="https://twitter.com/uuuteki">ann</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/conejocapital">bunny</a>. i sit with my laptop under a gorgeous and massive window surrounded by extremely large potted plants, reading and writing various things, including sending and receiving messages via slack, telegram, twitter, and signal. we go to famous mexican-run carroll gardens establishment cubana cafe for a meal, and when the workday is over i head back home. filipino dj <a href="https://twitter.com/ursickfantasy">kristen</a> texts me that she's near my apartment. i'm about to hang up a curtain rod in my apartment so i ask her to help me. we hang up the rod. we walk past all 400,000 people drinking on canal street to go to 169 bar where we have a drink outside and discuss her dj career and my event hosting career which is me having had one single drain gang themed event in the smallest bar in brooklyn, jade. we go to wedding banquet liquor store because <a href="https://twitter.com/ursickfantasy">kristen</a> wants a "big bottle of soju" but they don't have the one she wants. i go home and she goes to kiki's to listen to doss in her headphones.</p>
    <p id="women" data-date="052824" data-type="social">at 5:30 my grifter friend <a href="https://twitter.com/__mihir">mihir</a> comes to see an apartment in my building because i am trying to get someone to live in the unit and advertised it to people since i want my friends to be my neighbors. i meet him in the unit and it's slightly smaller than mine but the way it's renovated is at least one thousand or perhaps even one million times better than the way mine was renovated. the broker tells me the landlord found new contractors that are the same price as the ones that did my apartment but do a way better job. i feel proud of the contractors that did my apartment for getting away with an iconic grift but am annoyed that i got a shittily renovated apartment as a result. <a href="https://twitter.com/__mihir">mihir</a> seems interested in the apartment and indicates to me during conversation that he's interested in engaging in monk-like behaviors and therefore is willing to live in an apartment much smaller than his current one. he asks me for some input on a grift he's doing. i advise. <a href="https://twitter.com/__mihir">mihir</a> leaves for a dinner in brooklyn with our friends <a href="https://twitter.com/sowaasays">sowa</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/arbitragegoth">john</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/negroprogrammer">regy</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/protecturflame">gabe</a>. i don't go because i've already committed to going to kiki's with a significant contingent of beach club, a women-only crypto industry social club. i meet with <a href="https://twitter.com/ktrivs">kayla</a>, world-trotting modular ecosystem maven <a href="https://twitter.com/natn3t">nat</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/camidarling">cami</a>, a recent chicago-to-new-york immigrant who i've never met before but already knows everyone else due to her beach club affiliation. i get a watermelon juice, we go to seward park where <a href="https://twitter.com/abigailcarlson_">abi</a> meets us, and then go to reception for a scrumptious cocktail. <a href="https://twitter.com/gabriellemic">gab</a> meets all of us at kiki's and we chow. they get on the train and i walk home and immediately tweet "i've been really enjoying hanging out with women recently!"</p>
    <p id="weekend" data-date="052624" data-type="social">ok is it just me or is this long weekend lowkey giving long weekend? on friday i'm working from sapphic crypto industry insider <a href="https://twitter.com/gabriellemic">gab</a>'s back yard in gorgeous bushwick. she loves making a delicious meal and other wholesome activities so we go to the grocery store and select some scrumptious morsels for her to plop on the grill. <a href="https://twitter.com/ktrivs">kayla</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/gabriellemic">gab</a> collab on a simply divine watermelon salad and we eat chicken with eddie on their back deck. today is unintentionally an influencer hang day for me, so i divest from canadian tech lifestyle influencer nyc content creator crypto influencer <a href="https://twitter.com/ktrivs">kayla trivieri</a> and hop on the j with the intention of going to celebrate the birthday of digital marketing guru livestreaming public speaker <a href="https://twitter.com/hotgirlweenie">digital darlenne</a> at papillon but i'm way too late and by the time the birthday squad relocates to joyface i'm texting <a href="https://twitter.com/hotgirlweenie">darlenne</a>chella attendees <a href="https://twitter.com/alex_williamsa">alex</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/morejelly">jasper</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/allcaps_CHRIST">christian</a> who warn me that many are not getting into the venue so i don't pull up. non-binary latina crypto cabal member <a href="https://twitter.com/conejocapital">bunny</a> messages me at 1:28am, saying "gmeowww" quickly followed by "i was thinking bosser noviana cervixlicious clubana", a particularly verbose way of telling me he's going to listen to techno music in bushwick. i want to go to bed so i go to bed. friday is about techfluencers, and saturday is about artists, comedians, and drinking alcohol. i wake up late and arrive at cartoonist and visual artist <a href="https://twitter.com/shaumbe">shaumbe</a>'s birthday/memorial day cookout in prospect lefferts gardens after the event has officially ended at 2pm. <a href="https://twitter.com/shaumbe">shaumbe</a> immediately hands me a lei and i say hi to his wife <a href="https://twitter.com/_grandmaemily">emily</a> who comments that she is seeing my knees for perhaps the first time because i'm usually caught in extremely large pants or shorts that extend below the knee. i drink a really crazy and irresponsible combination of alcoholic beverages in their backyard, including desecrating a berry lemonade jones soda by pouring white rum into it. <a href="https://twitter.com/alex_williamsa">alex</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/allcaps_CHRIST">christian</a> pull up. we play cornhole. <a href="https://twitter.com/morejelly">jasper</a> pulls up. everyone there tells me that they're either an artist, a comedian, or a member of <a href="https://twitter.com/shaumbe">shaumbe</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/_grandmaemily">emily</a>'s williamsburg church and everyone talks about how we all know each other from twitter. local comedy celebrity <a href="https://twitter.com/camerobradford">cameron bradford</a> is there. some people i've seen at <a href="https://twitter.com/shaumbe">shaumbe</a>-related social events before are there. <a href="https://twitter.com/shaumbe">shaumbe</a> and i create online content that bullies <a href="https://twitter.com/hanfjob">clay parks</a> for not coming to the party despite rsvp-ing "going" to the partiful event. i eat an unreasonable amount of pulled pork, sometimes mixing it with french onion dip. i text techfluencer <a href="https://twitter.com/ktrivs">kayla</a> to come and we leave, walking to venture capital and marketing expert <a href="https://twitter.com/abigailcarlson_">abi</a>'s apartment in windsor terrace, where we drink wine and i go hyperverbal in an attempt to dissect the grifts of people in our immediate social circle. <a href="https://twitter.com/conejocapital">bunny</a> arrives at some unreasonable hour and the two of us walk to 7 eleven for snacks and bevvies. when i take a lyft home at around 6am, my key doesn't work in the door to my unit. it breaks. i don't have access to my bed so i take the train to <a href="https://twitter.com/conejocapital">bunny</a>'s and sleep in his bed, which he never uses because he is quirked up and always sleeps on the couch. on sunday i unintentionally lean into being nonverbal autistic. i'm supposed to host a barbecue event at prospect park along with <a href="https://twitter.com/blissposting">david</a>, a music producer and member of based retard gang who adds me as a cohost to all his events because we think it's funny. what was originally meant to be a memorial day grill sesh has been combined with neoliberal hell podcast co-host and downtown scene-adjacent socialite <a href="https://twitter.com/matthdonovan">matthew donovan</a>'s birthday when <a href="https://twitter.com/blissposting">david</a> discovered they were happening at the same time in roughly the same place. i'm extremely tired and my vibe is off because i slept at <a href="https://twitter.com/conejocapital">bunny</a>'s but we both get going in time to be only an hour late to the event. maybe two hours. people are texting me that they showed up and i wasn't there. when <a href="https://twitter.com/conejocapital">bunny</a> and i walk out of his apartment we immediately encounter famous crypto twitter celebrity <a href="https://twitter.com/bonecondor">birb</a> and then <a href="https://twitter.com/sunnydece">stephy</a>, who is visiting new york from vancouver and once gave me galaxy-brained crypto career advice on the phone, arrives to go to the park with us. <a href="https://twitter.com/sunnydece">stephy</a> keeps pointing out that things in new york are the way they are, but like in an insightful way. her fascination and curiosity make me realize that the things my friends and i do and have normalized are actually kind of weird and not normal. when <a href="https://twitter.com/conejocapital">bunny</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/sunnydece">stephy</a>, and i finally find the memorial day grill sesh x <a href="https://twitter.com/matthdonovan">matthew donovan</a> birthday party i immediately talk to co-host <a href="https://twitter.com/blissposting">david</a>, group chat ringleader and provocative musician <a href="https://twitter.com/selfimmolati0n">dull</a>, elite substacker <a href="https://twitter.com/f4eth">kathy</a>, intellectual and technologist <a href="https://twitter.com/weymarjohansson">weyland</a>, and milady grifter and $egirl boydev <a href="https://twitter.com/griftsh0p">keegan</a>. i later encounter <a href="https://twitter.com/elizardbethc">elizabeth</a>, who has been convinced by a text blast that i sent to the attendees that i am homeless and in need of money. the reason she thinks this is because the text blast said i was homeless and in need of money. when she reaches into her purse, seemingly about to literally actually give me money, i explain that i was lying and larping as a stereotypical polyamorous bushwick resident who makes a gofundme to escape a "toxic" living situation for fun. faang tech genius <a href="https://instagram.com/davidbui.psd">david</a> arrives, as well as the music-head duo <a href="https://twitter.com/ultraslut">blake</a> and <a href="https://instagram.com/halsey.wav">david</a>. there are a lot of davids. i run into history phd student and occasional gay twitter main character <a href="https://twitter.com/comradesanchez">jose</a>. i feel extremely nonverbal autistic and weird because i have not showered and am itching to get home and call a locksmith to get into my apartment where my nonverbal autism will go unseen. i see a few people that i should probably say hi to but i don't because i am feeling nonverbal autistic: other $egirl boydev <a href="https://twitter.com/nobody_clothing">mark</a>, dimes square reporter <a href="https://twitter.com/mcrumps">mike crumplar</a>, and clouted tiktok-twitter crossposter <a href="https://twitter.com/coldhealing">coldhealing</a>, to name a few. my nonverbal autism compels me to leave. i leave, nonverbally and autistically take the train to my apartment, and divest from society and culture for the rest of the day in favor of being nonverbal autistic.</p>
